### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    I enjoyed Lab 12 most of all for 2 reasons. The first reason is we were able
    to create image files that did not exist beforehand using only code. The 
    second reason is that we were using an image library that allowed us to create
    images using RGB values.

* Lab 11

    What I liked about Lab 11 was that we were able to load external files and use them
    as vectors in our code. I have worked with csv files and manipulating data in excel 
    before and using C++ seems like a much faster way of doing that.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was enjoyable to learn how to use code to check if a number is prime. It was
    also interesting to learn how to get command line arguments into our code. This 
    opened up my eyes to what is possible with coding.
